title: Scraping Environment Preparation

The following setup provides a comprehensive approach for both Windows and Mac users to create a structured project directory, download necessary files, and set up an isolated Python environment for web scraping. 

By following these instructions, you will have a consistent and reproducible development environment, which is crucial for academic and professional projects.


## Creating the Project Structure

### For Windows Users

1. Open Command Prompt (you can do this by typing `cmd` in the Windows search bar and hitting Enter).

2. Create a new folder called `market-research`:

```bash
mkdir market-research
```

3. Navigate into the `market-research` folder:

```bash
cd market-research
```

4. Create a subfolder called `data-collection`:
   
```bash
mkdir data-collection
```

### For Mac Users

1. Open Terminal (you can find this in the Applications folder under Utilities, or use Spotlight by pressing Cmd + Space and typing "Terminal").

2. Create a new folder called `market-research`:

```bash
mkdir market-research
```

3. Navigate into the `market-research` folder:

```bash
cd market-research
```

4. Create a subfolder called `data-collection`:

```bash
mkdir data-collection
```

## Downloading the YAML File Using `curl`

**For Both Windows and Mac Users:**

Navigate into the `data-collection` folder before using `curl` to download the YAML file (I assume you already are in the folder `market-research`). This ensures the file is saved in the right place: 

```bash
cd data-collection
```

Now use the `curl` command to download the `env-scraping.yml` file:

```bash
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/environments/main/ss2024/env-scraping.yml
```

### Understanding `curl` and Its Parameters

After downloading the file, let's revisit what the `curl` command does and its parameters, now with the context of downloading into the `data-collection` folder:

- **`-L`**: Follows any redirects which the server might send as part of the request.
- **`-J`**: Uses the header-provided filename to save the file.
- **`-O`**: Saves the file locally with the same name as the filename on the server.

## Setting Up the Anaconda Environment

**Important Note:** Before proceeding with the creation of the Anaconda environment, ensure you are in the `data-collection` folder where the `env-scraping.yml` file is located. This is crucial because the `conda` command looks for the YAML file in your current directory.

**Create the Anaconda Environment:**

```bash
conda env create -f env-scraping.yml
```
This command will create a new environment named `scraping` and install all the dependencies listed in the YAML file.

**Activate the Environment:**

```bash
conda activate scraping
```
Activating the environment will switch your current session to use the Python version and libraries specified in the environment.

### Understanding the YML-file in its Content

**YAML File**: YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard that can be used for configuration files and other forms of data that need to be stored and transmitted. In the context of Anaconda, a YAML file specifies the environment's name, the channels to install packages from, and the list of dependencies.

The provided YAML file contains:

- **name**: `scraping` – the environment name.
- **channels**: 
  - `conda-forge`: a community-led collection of recipes for conda.
  - `defaults`: the default channel provided by Anaconda.
- **dependencies**: the packages and versions to install:
  - `python=3.11` – Python version 3.11.
  - `pip` – The Python package installer.
  - Other packages within the pip subsection for various tasks:
    - `pandas`, `openpyxl` for data manipulation.
    - `jupyter` for running Jupyter notebooks.
    - `altair`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization.
    - `requests`, `tweepy`, `beautifulsoup4` for web scraping.
    - `autopep8` for code formatting.
